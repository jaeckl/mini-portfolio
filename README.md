# Portfolio Projects
A small list of projects that I am proud of publicly displaying.
## Mutlitap Delay Plugin

This is a project using the C++ framework JUCE. It is useful as an audio delay effect. On a canvas you can add new delay offsets and adjust their mix ratio. You can also select between some rythmic presets or load custom ones stored as xml files.
